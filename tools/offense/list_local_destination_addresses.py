Use cases:
  - Identify most targeted internal assets
  - Find destinations involved in multiple offenses (cross-offense correlation)
  - Prioritize asset protection by magnitude
  - Analyze attack patterns (which sources target which destinations)
  - Track attack timelines (first/last seen)
  - Focus security controls on frequently targeted IPs

Each destination address includes:
  - Associated offense IDs
  - Magnitude (calculated severity)
  - Event/flow counts
  - First and last seen timestamps
  - Network classification
  - Associated source address IDs

"Local" indicates internal/protected assets within your network.

Use filtering to find specific destinations (e.g., 'magnitude > 7' or
'local_destination_ip = \"10.0.1.50\"')."""
