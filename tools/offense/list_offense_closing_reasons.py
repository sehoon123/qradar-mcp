CRITICAL: Use this tool to get valid closing_reason_id values before calling
update_offense to close an offense.

Use cases:
  - Get valid closing reason IDs for offense closure workflow
  - Display available closing reasons to analysts
  - Filter out deleted or reserved reasons
  - Audit available closing reasons

By default, excludes deleted and reserved closing reasons (most common use case).
Use include_deleted=true or include_reserved=true to see all reasons.

Note: Deleted and reserved closing reasons cannot be used to close offenses."""
