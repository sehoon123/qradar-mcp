## Overview

This MCP server provides AI agents with the ability to interact with IBM QRadar SIEM through a comprehensive set of tools covering offenses, reference data, assets, log sources, analytics, and more. It can be deployed as a standalone service using Docker or run locally.

## Features

- **FastMCP Framework**: Modern, async-first MCP server implementation with uvicorn (ASGI)
- **MCP Protocol Compliance**: Full implementation of Model Context Protocol specification
- **27 Tools (Phase 1)**: Read-only QRadar API coverage
  - Offense Management (7 tools) - List and retrieve offense data
  - Reference Data (6 tools) - Query reference sets, maps, and tables
  - Asset Management (2 tools) - List assets and properties
  - Log Sources (3 tools) - Query log source configurations
  - Analytics Rules (6 tools) - Retrieve rules, building blocks, and custom actions
  - System Administration (4 tools) - System info, servers, users, and roles
  - Forensics (2 tools) - Query forensics cases
  - QVM (2 tools) - Vulnerability and asset data
- **Dual Authentication**: Supports both user sessions and authorized service tokens

**Phase 1 Release**: This initial release includes **27 read-only tools** focused on querying and retrieving QRadar data. Additional tools for data modification and advanced search capabilities will be rolled out in future releases.

### Roadmap

**Future Releases** will include:
- **Write Operations**: Tools for creating, updating, and deleting QRadar data (POST/DELETE operations)
- **Ariel Search**: Full AQL query execution and saved search management (8 additional tools)
- **Network Services**: IP geolocation, DNS, and WHOIS lookups (5 additional tools)
- **Enhanced Reference Data**: Create and modify reference sets, maps, and tables

## Deployment

The QRadar MCP Server can be deployed in multiple ways depending on your needs.

### Prerequisites

- Docker 20.10+ and Docker Compose 2.0+ (for containerized deployment)
- Python 3.11+ (for local development)
- Access to a QRadar SIEM deployment
- QRadar SIEM authentication tokens (SEC/CSRF or Authorized Service token)

### Option 1: Docker Compose (Recommended)

The easiest way to deploy the MCP server is using Docker Compose.

1. **Clone the repository and navigate to the directory:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/IBM/qradar-mcp.git
   cd qradar-mcp
   ```

2. **Create configuration file:**
   ```bash
   cp config.example.json config.json
   # Edit config.json with your QRadar credentials
   ```

3. **Set environment variables:**

   Create a `.env` file:
   ```bash
   cat > .env << EOF
   QRADAR_HOST=your-qradar-host.com
   LOG_LEVEL=info
   EOF
   ```

4. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

5. **View logs:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs -f qradar-mcp
   ```

6. **Stop the server:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

The server will be available at `http://localhost:5001` (mapped from internal port 5000).

### Option 2: Manual Docker Build

For more control over the Docker deployment:

1. **Build the image:**
   ```bash
   docker build -t qradar-mcp:latest .
   ```

2. **Run the container:**
   ```bash
   docker run -d \
     --name qradar-mcp-server \
     -p 5001:5000 \
     -e LOG_LEVEL=info \
     -v $(pwd)/config.json:/opt/app-root/config.json:ro \
     -v $(pwd)/logs:/opt/app-root/logs \
     qradar-mcp:latest
   ```

   **Important**: The config.json file must be mounted at `/opt/app-root/config.json` for authentication. Make sure you've created and configured `config.json` from `config.example.json` before running.

   The server will be available at `http://localhost:5001` (mapped from internal port 5000).

3. **Check status:**
   ```bash
   docker ps
   docker logs qradar-mcp-server
   ```

### Option 3: Run Local with Python

For local development with Python without Docker:

1. **Create virtual environment (recommended):**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

3. **Configure authentication:**
   ```bash
   cp config.example.json config.json
   # Edit config.json with your QRadar credentials

   # Copy config to parent directory (required for local mode)
   cp config.json ../config.json
   ```

4. **Run the server:**
   ```bash
   python server.py
   ```

The server will start at `http://localhost:5000`. The port can be modified in server.py if port conflicts occur.

**Note**: The config loader looks for `config.json` in the parent directory of the qradar-mcp folder when running locally. This is by design to support both Docker (where config is at `/opt/app-root/config.json`) and local Python modes.

### Verify Deployment

Use the provided test script to verify your deployment:

```bash
# Run the connection test
python tests/local_mcp_connection.py
```

This script will:
1. Load authentication from your `config.json`
2. Connect to the MCP server at `http://localhost:5001`
3. Initialize the MCP session
4. List all available tools
5. Display the first 10 tools

Expected output:
```
QRadar MCP Server - Local Container Test
==================================================
Endpoint: http://localhost:5001/mcp
Auth: Using authorized service token from config.json
...
✅ Found 32 tools
==================================================
✅ MCP Server is fully operational in local mode!
==================================================
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `QRADAR_HOST`: QRadar instance hostname
- `QRADAR_SEC_TOKEN`: QRadar SEC token (for user sessions)
- `QRADAR_CSRF_TOKEN`: QRadar CSRF token (for user sessions)
- `QRADAR_AUTH_TOKEN`: Authorized service token (alternative to SEC/CSRF)

### Configuration Files

- `config.json`: Main configuration (not committed)
- `config.example.json`: Configuration template
- `mcp_settings.json`: MCP-specific settings (not committed)
- `mcp_settings.example.json`: Settings template

## Security

- **Never commit `config.json` or `mcp_settings.json`** - They contain sensitive tokens
- Tokens are session-based and expire - refresh as needed
- Use `verify_ssl: true` in production
- All endpoints require authentication
- Supports both user sessions and authorized service tokens


## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Authentication errors (401)**: Refresh your QRadar tokens
- **Connection refused**: Verify QRadar host is accessible
- **SSL errors**: Set `verify_ssl: false` for testing
- **Tool not found**: Ensure MCP server is properly initialized
